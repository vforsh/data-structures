# data-structures
This repo is me trying to fill the knowledge gap I have in basics of CS. Things like sorting algorithms and commonly used data structures.


## Learning resources
Here are the courses I have used:
- [The Ultimate Data Structures and Algorithms](https://codewithmosh.com/p/data-structures-algorithms)
- [Learn Binary Search in JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/algorithmsguide)
- [Learn Merge Sort in JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/mergesort)
